The launch of a space vehicle starts with a period of powered flight in
which the vehicle is lifted from the ground to above the atmosphere. The end
of this powered flight period, known as burnout, initiates the vehicle's
free flight. At this point, the vehicle's trajectory can be determined based on
its location and its velocity in the x, y, and z direction. In this simulator, our
vehicle has just reached free flight and is at <6000, -5500, -3300>.

Input vehicle's velocity in meters per second.
